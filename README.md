#  STAR-Bench - Micro-Benchmark Suite for Time-Aware Reasoning 

## Getting Started
Pre-generated benchmarks can be found in the "benchmark" directory.
Benchmarks can be generated using the scripts in the "scripts" directory.
The script "cbconvert.sh" can be used to convert data and dependencies from
chasebench. The chasebench repository needs to be cloned beforehand.
