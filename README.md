#  STAR bench - microbenchmark Suite for Time-Aware Reasoning 

## Getting Started
Benchmarks can be generated using the scripts in the "scripts" directory.
The script "cbconvert.sh" can be used to convert data and dependencies from
chasebench. The chasebench repository needs to be cloned beforehand. 

Benchmarks in the thesis can be generated by running the "setup.sh" script.
