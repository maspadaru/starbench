#  STAR bench - microbenchmark Suite for Time-Aware Reasoning 

## Getting Started
Pre-generated benchmarks can be found in the "benchmark" directory.
Benchmarks can be generated using the scripts in the "scripts" directory.
The script "cbconvert.sh" can be used to convert data and dependencies from
chasebench. The chasebench repository needs to be cloned beforehand. 

TODO:
- How to generate all streams
- How to convert chasebench
- Benchmark folder should be empty, and generated by script. Because files
are too large for github.
- LARS Programs in Benchmark folder should be moved to some other place
